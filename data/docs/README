MiAZ, a Personal Document Organizer

Sometimes, it is quite a challenge to keep the documentation of the family, schools, institutions, billing, etc... well organized in terms of classification, necessary space, time to do it and effort. At least, that is my case (born and lived half life in Spain, working now in Luxembourg, and living in Germany).

MiAZ is an attempt to fix this problem: with a little effort, have all papework organized. By a little effort I mean to scan letters, donwload attachments from emails, place it in the right MiAZ repository directory, and edit the filename according to a set of fixed rules (choose the country, the proper date, the group, a purpose, a concept, the sender, and the receiver). MiAZ helps you out with the these rules in a effortless way.

# Features

* Possibility of using one or more document repositories. One at time. But it can be switched at any time.
* No database. The directory holding the documents is the database. Properties are extracted from the own filenames. It uses some supporting configurations files to enable a proper identification of those properties (e.g..: FAM means family)
* Workspace:
** MiAZ allows to import documents or directories (even in a  recursive way)
** It is fast. The Workspace view can deal with hundred or thousand of files.
** Filtering and search: The Workspace view have built-in drop-downs to help find documents easily.
** Support for projects: those documents related between them can be (un)assigned to projects (eg.: all those documents related to the same tax stament). A document can belong to none, one or several projects).
** Single renaming: a useful feature to rename a single document easily.
* Plug-in system: in order to avoid large modifications in the code base, MiAZ uses a plug-in system to enable and extend the functionality and the UI.
** Current 'system' plugins:
*** Mass renaming: when importing several documents, sometimes is useful to assign the same property to all of them (e.g.: same country). This functionality allows MiAZ to do mass renaming for countries, groups, purposes, senders, receivers, etc...)
*** Export plugins: enable to export document names to CSV, plain text. But it also allows to export document to another directory or even zip them.


# Use case

This project is based solely in my own experience and for my own necesities.

It helps to organize the day to day paperwork such as invoices, letters, and any document sent by/to any person (legal entity or natural)

With this in mind, MiAZ uses its own filename convention in order to manage the repository of documents.


# File name convention

All documents managed by MiAZ are renamed following this name convention consisting on 7 fields:

`{timestamp}-{country}-{group}-{sentby}-{purpose}-{concept}-{sentto}.{extension}`

* _Timestamp_: with format: %Y%m%d (eg.: 20221119)
* _Country_: ISO-3166 Alpha-2 code (eg.: ES)
* _Group_: root category to which many documents belong to with a similar purpose. (eg.: HOUSE, EDU, BANKS, WORK, ADM)
* _Purpose_: reason (eg.: INFO, REQUEST, INVOICE, STATEMENT, etc...)
* _SentBy_: the (legal or natural) person sending the document
* _Concept_: the details (eg.: invoice number, flight number, etc...)
* _SentTo_: the (legal or natural) person receiving the document


# NOTES

* Each field is separated by a hyphen (`-`). Only 6 hyphens are allowed. Extra hyphens found in a field are automatically converted to underscores (`_`)
* Country code is important in case that the family has ties with others countries apart from the one where they reside)
* The timestamp format helps to sort documents easily in a file browser
* SentBy/SentTo fields are stored as a key/value where key is a identifier (eg.: person initials) and value is the full name (eg.: Company or person name)
