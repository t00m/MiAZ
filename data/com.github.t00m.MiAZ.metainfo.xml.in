  <description>
    <p>Sometimes, it is quite a challenge to keep the documentation of the family, schools, administration, billing, etc... well organized in terms of classification, disk space, time to do it and effort.</p>
    <p>MiAZ app aims to solve this problem: with minimal effort, it is possible to have all paperwork organized.</p>
    <p>A little effort means: scan letters, donwload attachments from emails, place it in the right MiAZ repository directory, and edit the filename according to a set of fixed rules, like choosing the country, date, group, purpose, sender and receiver.</p>
    <p>MiAZ helps you comply with these rules effortlessly.</p>
    <p>Features:
    - One or more document repositories
    - No database. The directory holding the documents is the database. Properties are extracted from the own filenames. Configuration files reside in the same repository.
    - Workspace: a single place where you can view/edit your documents
    - Filtering and search: built-in drop-downs to help finding documents easily.
    - It is fast. Depending on the volume of documents and the hardware capacity of your device, thousands of documents can be displayed in seconds.
    - Support for projects: those documents related between them can be (un)assigned to projects (eg.: all those documents related to the same tax stament year).
    - Single renaming: a useful feature to rename a single document easily.
    - Mass renaming: when importing several documents, sometimes is useful to assign the same property to all of them (e.g.: same country). This functionality allows MiAZ to do mass renaming for countries, groups, purposes, senders, and receivers, saving you a lot of time.
    - Predefined properties: To expedite the document archiving process, you can select from a default set of values. For instance, for groups, among othe values, you have MED, INS, BIL (MEDICAL, INSURANCE, BILLING respectively). Same for purposes. These values can be edited.
    - Plug-in system: in order to avoid large modifications in the code base, MiAZ uses a plug-in system to extend the functionality and the UI. MiAZ comes with a set of standard plugins to help you importing documents from several sources (a single file, a directory, from the scanner, etc...), and also for exporting them (to excel, CSV, to another directory, in a zip file, as filenames in a plain text file, etc...)
